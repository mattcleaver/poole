##6 Things East Texas Small Business Owners Don't Know About Online Marketing

After working in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex for nearly ten years, my wife and I were ready for a change of pace and moved to Athens, Texas. In doing so, I completely redesigned my website business to be the ultimate shop for small business owners in east Texas based on what they need to know. Here are the X things:

###1. You Should Ignore Facebook
Yes, I know social media is all the rage these days, but it is mostly all hype. This all comes down to return on investment. I have done the work and measured the results, and for nearly all small business owners there are more effective ways to spend your time and money than worrying about Facebook. And there is one technique that very few small businesses are using that is ten times more effective than Facebook that I will show you how to use.

###2. Function Beats Form Every Time
When most business owners make their first website or redesign an existing one, they want it to look good. The problem is, looking good might not be the best way to make your business more money. You website is not an art gallery, it is salesperson who works 24 hours a day 365 days a year, doesn't get paid comission, never takes a vacation, and doesn't need healthcare benefits. I optimize your website to be a functional selling machine that makes you money.

###3. Half of your website visitors are on mobile devices

###3. Website Speed is More Important than You Think
Out here in east Texas, our website speeds are slower than the national average. And about 50% of your website visitors will access it via their phone and our spotty cell data networks. Study on conversion rate and website speed. That means a complicated website that takes a long time to load won't ever be seen by potential customers, because they won't wait for it to load. Without getting into the nitty-gritty technical details, I have completely rethought my website design workflow and redesigned my server architecture to be able to offer some of the fastest websites possible. This website you are reading now is faster than XX% of all websites.

###4. Your Time is Too Valuable to Do-It-Yourself

###5. You Won't Actually Update Your Own Website
When I first started my business, I made sure people could update their website, and none did.

###6. Chances Are, Your Website Will Get Hacked

I build on a super-secure platform and record every change I ever make. We can always go back. And, I keep X copies as backups.
